This project was inspired by our participation in PSA Code Sprint 2025, a national hackathon where my team of four developed an innovative data-driven solution for PSA.

Our project uses Streamlit UI, Power BI Rest API, DAX translator, Azure OpenAI (GPT-4) API. 

Our solution aims to streamline data interpretation and accelerate the generation of actionable insights, enabling PSA to make smarter, faster, and more informed operational decisions.
